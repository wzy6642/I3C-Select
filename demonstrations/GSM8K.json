        "question": "Karen is constantly trying to stop the raccoons from getting in her trash. The first lock she tries stalls them for 5 minutes. The next lock stalls them for 3 minutes less than three times as long as the first lock. When Karen tries both locks at once, it stalled the raccoons for five times as long as the second lock alone. How long is that?",
        "answer": "First find how long the second lock stalls them: 5 minutes * 3 - 3 minutes = <<5*3-3=12>>12 minutes\nThen multiply that amount by 5 to find the total time the third lock stall the raccoon: 12 minutes * 5 = <<12*5=60>>60 minutes\n#### 60",
        "reasoning": "First, we're told that the first lock stalls the raccoons for 5 minutes.\nThe second lock stalls them for 3 minutes less than three times as long as the first lock. So, if we let the time the first lock stalls the raccoons be represented as T1 and the time the second lock stalls them be T2:\nT1 = 5 minutes\nTo find T2, we use the information given:\nT2 = 3 * T1 - 3 minutes\nSubstitute the value of T1:\nT2 = 3 * 5 minutes - 3 minutes\nT2 = 15 minutes - 3 minutes\nT2 = 12 minutes\nNow, when Karen tries both locks at once, it stalls the raccoons for five times as long as the second lock alone:\nBoth locks together = 5 * T2\nSubstitute the value of T2:\nBoth locks together = 5 * 12 minutes\nBoth locks together = 60 minutes\nSo, when Karen uses both locks at the same time, they stall the raccoons for 60 minutes.",

        "reasoning": "First, determine the total number of puppies. If each of the 3 pregnant dogs gives birth to 4 puppies, then the total number of puppies is:\n3 pregnant dogs * 4 puppies/dog = 12 puppies\nEach puppy needs 2 shots, so the total number of shots needed for all the puppies is:\n12 puppies * 2 shots/puppy = 24 shots\nEach shot costs $5, so the total cost of the shots for all the puppies is:\n24 shots * $5/shot = $120\nTherefore, the shots cost Chuck a total of $120.",

        "answer": "He saves 150,000*.1=$<<150000*.1=15000>>15,000 per year\nHe needs 450,000*.2=$<<450000*.2=90000>>90,000\nSo he needs to save for 90,000/15,000=<<90000/15000=6>>6 years\n#### 6",
        "reasoning": "First, let's calculate how much Mike saves per year:\nMike earns $150,000 per year and saves 10% of that. To find out how much he saves annually, we calculate 10% of $150,000:\n0.10 * $150,000 = $15,000\nSo, Mike saves $15,000 each year.\nNext, let's determine the total amount he needs for the down payment:\nThe house costs $450,000, and he needs to save 20% of that for a downpayment. To find out the down payment amount, we calculate 20% of $450,000:\n0.20 * $450,000 = $90,000\nNow, let's figure out how many years it will take Mike to save the $90,000 needed for the down payment:\nSince he saves $15,000 per year, we divide the total down payment amount by his annual savings:\n$90,000 / $15,000 = 6\nTherefore, it will take Mike 6 years to save enough for the down payment on the house.",

        "reasoning": "Sure, let's break it down:\n1. John has 3 bedroom doors to replace. Each bedroom door costs half the amount of an outside door. An outside door costs $20, so each bedroom door costs $20 / 2 = $10.\n2. He has 3 bedroom doors, each costing $10, so the total cost for the bedroom doors is 3 * $10 = $30.\n3. He also has 2 outside doors to replace, each costing $20. So, the total cost for the outside doors is 2 * $20 = $40.\n4. Now, we just need to add the cost of the bedroom doors and the outside doors together to get the total cost. So, $30 (bedroom doors) + $40 (outside doors) = $70.\nTherefore, John pays a total of $70 to replace all the doors.",

        "reasoning": "To calculate how many weeks the village of 72 people will last for both the vampire and the werewolf, we need to consider both of their weekly 'diets'.\nThe vampire drains three people per week.\nThe werewolf eats five people per week, but only fresh ones, meaning he cannot eat the ones the vampire has drained.\nEvery week, the vampire will drain 3 people and the werewolf will eat 5 different people. Thus, together they will go through 3 + 5 = 8 people per week.\nNow, we divide the total number of people in the village by the total number of people they go through in a week:\n72 people / 8 people per week = 9 weeks\nTherefore, the village of 72 people will last them both for 9 weeks before they run out of people.",
